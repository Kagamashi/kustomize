_________________________________

Kustomize is natively integrated with kubectl, so you can use kubectl commands to apply Kustomize configurations directly to a Kubernetes cluster without needing to separately install Kustomize.


# View final generated manifest
Preview final YAML manifest generated by Kustomize
This process runs Kustomize build process and outputs it to terminal
> kubectl kustomize [path_to_kustomization_directory]
> kubectl kustomize ./overlays/dev


# Apply kustomize manifests to cluster
-k flag tells kubectl to treat specified directory as kustomize directory (with kustomization.yaml file)
> kubectl apply -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]
> kubectl apply -k ./overlays/prod


# Deleting resources managed by Kustomize
Remove resources managed by Kustomize configuration from a cluster
> kubectl delete -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]


# Diffing changes with Kustomize
See the difference between the current live state of resources in the cluster ad output of our Kustomize configuration
> kubectl diff -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]
